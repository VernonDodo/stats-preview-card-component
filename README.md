## My process

I basically built the desktop version first. Used HTML for the basic layout and styled it with my own pre-styled CSS classes.

For mobile, I adapted the desktop design using media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am much more adept at CSS now. I have even learnt by just looking at a design, how to style my CSS classes and then just apply those classes to html element.

For example, to center an element within the body:

```css
.center {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
```html
<div class="container center">
.
.
.
</div>
```

### Continued development

I will continue to work on styling with native css. Only once I have a firm grasp of styling with native CSS, will I move on to pre-styled CSS - need an understanding of native CSS first.
